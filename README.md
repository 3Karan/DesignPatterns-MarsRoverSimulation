## Exercise One: Design Patterns
- **Objective**: Demonstrate an understanding of six design patterns through coding.
- **Patterns Covered**:
  - **Behavioral Patterns**: Observer, Command
  - **Creational Patterns**: Singleton, Factory Method
  - **Structural Patterns**: Adapter, Decorator
- **Use Cases**: Real-world scenarios for each pattern.
- **Execution**: Each code snippet is independent and can be run separately.

### How to Run Exercise One
1. Navigate to the Exercise One folder.
2. Compile the Java files.
3. Execute the individual Java files to see the design patterns in action.

## Exercise Two: Mars Rover Simulation
- **Objective**: Simulate the movement of a Mars rover on a grid, implementing obstacle detection and boundary checks.
- **Features**:
  - User input for grid size, starting position, commands, and obstacles.
  - Movement commands: Move Forward, Turn Left, Turn Right.
- **Use Cases**: Various scenarios demonstrating movement and obstacle handling.

### How to Run Exercise Two
1. Navigate to the Exercise Two folder.
2. Compile the Java files.
3. Execute the Main class to start the simulation.

## How to Run the Exercises
To run either exercise, ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above installed. Use the following commands in the respective directories:

### Example Command
```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```
