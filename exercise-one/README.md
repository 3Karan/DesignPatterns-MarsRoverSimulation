# Exercise One: Design Patterns Implementation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns in Java. The objective is to showcase the use of behavioral, creational, and structural design patterns in a well-structured console application. The project adheres to SOLID principles and coding best practices.

## Design Patterns Implemented
### Behavioral Design Patterns
1. **Strategy Pattern**: Used for defining a family of algorithms and making them interchangeable.
2. **Observer Pattern**: Implemented to allow a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

### Creational Design Patterns
1. **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
2. **Factory Method Pattern**: Used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

### Structural Design Patterns
1. **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge between them.
2. **Composite Pattern**: Used to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
